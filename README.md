A social platform built for meaningful conversations with built-in privacy protections. 🛡️

## Vision 🌟

HashPost exists to create spaces where people can engage in genuine discussions without the pressure of permanent identity. We believe that thoughtful conversations happen when people feel safe to explore ideas, ask questions, and share perspectives without fear of judgment or harassment.

Our approach combines familiar social features with cryptographic privacy controls that protect user identities while maintaining the accountability needed for healthy communities.

## What Makes HashPost Different ✨

### Privacy Without Anonymity 🔐

Users interact through pseudonyms that can't be connected to their real identities by other users. This creates a middle ground between complete anonymity and permanent identity—people can build reputation and trust within communities while maintaining privacy across different spaces.

### Administrative Accountability 👥

While regular users can't correlate pseudonyms, the platform includes carefully controlled administrative tools for moderation and legal compliance. These tools use cryptographic domain separation to ensure that administrative access is limited, audited, and transparent.

### Community-Focused Design 🤝

HashPost is built around communities where people can discuss shared interests, ask questions, and build knowledge together. The platform emphasizes content quality and meaningful interactions over viral engagement.

## Core Principles 💡

### Privacy by Design 🛡️

Every feature is designed with privacy in mind. User identities are protected through cryptographic controls, and the platform minimizes data collection while maintaining functionality.

### Transparency in Moderation 📋

Administrative actions are logged and auditable. When moderation is necessary, it's done transparently with clear reasoning and appropriate oversight.

### User Control 🎛️

Users have control over their pseudonyms, content, and privacy settings. The platform provides tools for users to manage their experience without requiring technical expertise.

### Sustainable Communities 🌱

The platform is designed to support healthy, long-term communities rather than viral growth. Features prioritize quality discussions and meaningful connections.

## Technology ⚙️

HashPost uses Identity-Based Encryption (IBE) to provide cryptographic privacy guarantees. The system separates different types of operations into distinct cryptographic domains, ensuring that compromise of one area doesn't affect others.

For detailed technical information, see the [documentation](docs/).
