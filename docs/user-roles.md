# User Roles & Permissions Overview

HashPost uses a role-based access control (RBAC) system to manage what users can do on the platform. Each user is assigned one or more roles, which grant specific permissions and capabilities.

## How Roles Affect Permissions

- **Platform-wide roles** grant permissions everywhere on HashPost.
- **Subforum roles** only apply within specific communities.
- **Capabilities** (like "ban users" or "remove content") are granted based on your role.

## How to Become an Admin or Moderator

- **Admins** are created by system operators.
- **Moderators** are assigned by subforum owners or admins.

## Security Notes
